    "In recent years I have learned that humility and honesty opens big doors. I have learned that we must leave aside envy and share with the people close . I know I have to be willing to change, and leave the comfort zone . I know value my time and the time of others. Read and have the world in head makes me an integrity person , for that reason no need to draft a list of values in this paragraph and the rest will come easily.",
